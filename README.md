This repository contains my implementations of various simple web development projects during CodeSoft internship!
Each project is designed to showcase my web developing skills and understanding of different concepts. 
Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

Task 1: A landing page which requires basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. This includes creating columns, dividing
sections, arranging items, and adding headers and footers and in CSS use appropriate alignments,
padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. The most important aspect is
unleashing the creativity to design an impressive page.

Task 2: Creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML is a popular beginner web development
project.

Task 3: create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, need to implement an
interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. 

Each project is contained within its respective directory in this repository. You can find detailed information, instructions, and the source code for each project in their respective folders. 
Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback!

but they serve as a way for me to practice and showcase my web development skills.
